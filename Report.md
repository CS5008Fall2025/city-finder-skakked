# Report
Fill out these report questions. 


1. What is the difference between a directed and undirected graph?
   > | Feature | Directed Graph | Undirected Graph |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Edge type | One-way arrow | Two-way line |
| Direction | Specific, one-way flow | Non-specific, two-way flow |
| Edge representation | (u,v) is not the same as (v,u) | (u,v) is the same as (v,u) |
| Common use | Dependencies, following, one-way systems | Mutual relationships, road networks |

2. What is the Big O of Dijkstra's algorithm.... 
   * Assuming you used an array (or list) to store the vertices.
   * Assuming you used a heap / priority queue to store the vertices.

3. Explain in your own words what that means for larger graphs when trying to find the shortest distance. 


## Deeper Thinking
4. For this assignment, you didn't need the most "efficient" set of data structures (for example, a heap wasn't required). However, think on the scale of google/apple maps - they have to deal with millions of vertices and edges. What data structures would you use to store the graph? Why? Somethings to consider - would you be able to store the entire graph at a time? Could you break it up into smaller pieces? How would you do that? Would there be advantages to caching/memoization of paths? You are free to explore your thoughts on this subject/reflect on various ideas. Other than a realization of some scalability of problems, there isn't a wrong answer. 




## Future Understanding
5. Related to shortest distance, is a problem called the "messenger" or "traveling sales person" problem commonly abbreviated to TSP. This problem is to find the shortest path that visits **every** vertex in a graph. Another way to look at it, is you are an delivery driver, and you have a series of packages to deliver. Can you find an optimal path for your deliveries that minimizes the total distance traveled? Imagine if you had 5 stops. How many different paths are there?  There are 120 possible paths to look at! (assuming fully connected routes). 
   * How many possible paths are there if you have 6 stops?
   * How many possible paths are there if you have 10 stops?
6. What type of growth is this problem? 
7. Take some time to research TSP problems. It falls under a certain classification of problems? What is it? 
8. Provide some examples of fields / problems that use TSP.



> [!TIP]
> We are having you explore TSP, so you can see the terms used for problem classification that are often the foundation of computer science theory. You will not be asked to know about TSP outside of this assignment or even problem classification. Computer Science is often about dealing with problems considered "too hard" or "impossible", and finding ways to make them possible! As such, knowing topics such as N, NP, NP-Complete, etc. is important to understand the limits (to break).


## Technical Interview Practice Questions
For both these questions, are you are free to use what you did as the last section on the team activities/answered as a group, or you can use a different question.

1. Select one technical interview question (this module or previous) from the [technical interview list](https://github.com/CS5008-khoury/Resources/blob/main/TechInterviewQuestions.md) below and answer it in a few sentences. You can use any resource you like to answer the question.

2. Select one coding question (this module or previous) from the [coding practice repository](https://github.com/CS5008-khoury/Resources/blob/main/LeetCodePractice.md) and include a c file with that code with your submission. Make sure to add comments on what you learned, and if you compared your solution with others.
